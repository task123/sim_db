**sim_db** is a command line tool and a set of functions for conveniently running a large number of simulations with different parameter values, while keeping track of these all simulation parameters and results along with metadata in a database for you. 

It should be easy enough to use that, even small project for simple simulations will benefit from using **sim_db**. However, if the users of your project are going to run simulations with many different parameters and/or running them on a cluster with a SLURM or PBE job scheduler, **sim_db** is a particularly good fit and highly recommended.
