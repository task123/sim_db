Purpose and Features
====================

		what actually was run weeks, months or even years later
		The next paragraph can be skipped as it just go through what it remembers, but the point is that it does remember it — all while been (hopefully) much less work that not using it. If it is going to be run with many different parameters and/or running on a cluster with a SLURM or PBE job scheduler, it is probably going to less work. 
		(What parameters was used, what was the result / where was it stored, what code was used to produce the result (for git projects) including what binary (was it compiled with this code), why was this simulation run, how long did it take to run on how many logical cpus on which hardware — while been less work to use that too not use it (that is at least the idea))
		few dependencies
		python, c and c++
		metadata automatically 
		many print options
		build to run on both local machine and super computer / cluster 
		multiple programs (of different languages) can read the same parameters - typically a program to run the simulation and a separate program to visualise the simulation.
